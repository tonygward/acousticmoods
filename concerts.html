					I was planning a trip to England and found Acoustic Moods had set a concert date for
					when I would be there. I knew this was my first opportunity to actually hear one of my
					favorite bands live in concert, an opportunity I surely did not want to miss. The
					setting was in the Urmston Cricket Club, a roomy but cozy place. I found a seat up front
					for best viewing, Chas was busy setting up and testing the sounds, lighting, and
					generally making sure all was set properly for the band. The band was tuning guitars,
					and settling into getting ready to play.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The lights dimmed, the spotlights came on, and Genesis' "No Son of Mine" filled the room.
					I knew, instantly, that I was in for a wonderful evening of music. "Afterglow" and
					"Happy Blues in 7/4" followed, and then one of my favorite originals by the band, "For
					Heather". Hearing it live for the first time was truly a delight! "Crazy Little Thing
					Called Love" had the audience clapping along, and a new release, "Suncatcher" which
					Chris narrated the history behind the song, is sure to be one of their biggest hits to
					come, followed by an unforgettable rendition of Solsbury Hill.</p>

						align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"><br><br>After the intermission, the band
					returned and began playing "Chantler Time", followed by more of my favorites, entangled
					and ripples. "L for Leather" was another that will also find a place on my ipod. After
					some more original material, the concert was drawing to a close. Acoustic Moods made it
					go out with a bang, with a full 11 mins of "Tryptych" which was absolutely remarkably
					played. I could go on and on about my thoughts on each song they performed that evening,
					it was just a purely fantastic concert and performance by all and an evening with
					Acoustic Moods that I will always remember.</p>
