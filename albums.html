			<p>Acoustic Moods began life as a covers band, playing and recording live concerts of music
				mainly by progressive rock band Genesis. It wasn't too long before original compositions
				started to materialise, but it was several years before the band went into the studio to
				record any of it! To date, Chris, Tony and Dan have produced around 3 hours worth of
				original music.</p>

			<p>The following albums are currently available from Acoustic Moods. Click an album cover to
				view more information.</p>

			<h1>Studio Albums - <span style="font-weight: normal;">all original compositions</span></h1>

			<p>The aptly-named 'Plugged' contains the first hour, as the boys finally plugged in to a mixing
				desk, and 'Suncatcher' is made up of the next hour, taking its name from the longest track
				on the album. The as yet unnamed third album is still to come.</p>

			<h1>Live Albums - <span style="font-weight: normal;">a mix of original music and covers</span></h1>

			<p>These albums showcase the best live performances of covers and Acoustic Moods originals. Much
				of their original material was performed numerous times before being recorded for the studio
				albums and new ideas would sneak in at every concert. This evolution is particularly
				apparent with 'Plugged' tracks, some of which were written 10 years before the album was
				released.</p>
